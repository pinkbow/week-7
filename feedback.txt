Additional Comments:
 - Good job! The landing page looks great! Content resizes appropriately and everything stays readable.

 - On the blog page your blog posts section stays at 700 px, which causes some problems on smaller displays. This would look better if it were switched to a percentage based width.
 
 - Nice work adding multiple media queries to handle multiple screens sizes!

 - The hamburger menu on the landing page is a great touch!
